**Carbon Footprint of ImageEngine**

This document explains the model used to arrive at an estimated carbon footprint of running ImageEngine.

The model is based on the “Sustainable Web Design version 4” ([SWD](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/calculating-digital-emissions/)) model and uses the recommended default values if the actual value is unknown.

Note: Version 4 of the SWD model is different from [version 3](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/estimating-digital-emissions-version-3/) used in 2023. Version 4 builds on more recent evidence and a breakdown between operational and embodied emissions for each segment. Emissions from 2024 to 2025 is not directly comparable for that reason.

Like we planned in 2023, during 2024 we've optimized the resorces needed to operate ImageEngine. This, combined with the way SWD version 4 calculate electricity spend per GB, shows that we've reduced electricity spend down to 20-25.000 kWh per month, about ~ 300.000 kWh per year across the entire network. This is down from ~ 750.000 kWh in 2023.

The numbers suggest that our efforts enable ImageEngine to serve more traffic with less energy use.

For some components the actual electricity use and data transfer is known, while for others (the majority) the estimate is based on traffic served by ImageEngine (after optimization) during a representative period. 

The estimate for 2025 is then based on historical data, but expected changes in traffic patterns and known changes to the infrastructure are considered in the estimate.

When the carbon intensity is not known, the default from the SWD model 494 g/kWh is used. Data from each of ImageEngine's data centres is used to define the carbon intensity. In addition, [AWS numbers from 2023](https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/products-services/aws-cloud?energyType=true) are used for relevant services still running in the cloud. 

The total embodied emissions are 0.106 kWh/GB, while emissions related to operations are 0.194 kWh/GB, a total of 0.3 kWh/GB.

Based on traffic patterns and actual usage across our network, the carbon intesity is 112	gCO2e/kWh.

All in all we estimate that the total emissions are 24MT Co2e for 12 months. Down from 43MT Co2e last year.

The unavoidable carbon footprint of 24 MT Co2e is offset by purchasing verified offsets from [Terrapass](https://terrapass.com/product/terrapass-climate-green-e-offsets/).
