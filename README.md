# ImageEngine and Sustainability


Even if emissions caused by images are significantly reduced by [ImageEngine](https://imageengine.io) , and the fact that most of ImageEngine is already powered by renewable energy, ImageEngine still has unavoidable emissions to account for.

For ImageEngine to be able to offer a global, low-latency service for all our customers and their users, weâ€™re sometimes forced to choose vendors which do not comply with our policy for renewable energy

This repository holds ImageEngines evidence of emissions and offsets.
